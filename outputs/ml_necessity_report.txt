WHY BANKS NEED ML - KEY REASONS
======================================================================

1. ACCURACY
   ML is 5.5% more accurate on average
   Better predictions = Fewer losses

2. ADAPTABILITY
   Traditional rules become outdated quickly
   ML learns new patterns automatically

3. SCALABILITY
   Manual rules don't scale to millions of transactions
   ML handles massive data volumes efficiently

4. COMPLEXITY
   Traditional methods use simple IF-THEN rules
   ML captures complex, non-linear relationships

5. ROI
   $887.4M annual savings
   Implementation cost: ~$1-2M
   Payback period: <6 months

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES
======================================================================

• JPMorgan Chase: Uses ML for fraud detection
  Result: 50% reduction in false positives

• PayPal: ML-powered fraud prevention
  Result: Saves $800M+ annually in fraud losses

• Goldman Sachs: Algorithmic trading with ML
  Result: 15-20% better returns than traditional strategies

• Upstart: ML-based credit scoring
  Result: Approves 27% more borrowers with same default rate

CONCLUSION
======================================================================

Financial institutions NEED machine learning because:

✓ Traditional methods cannot keep up with modern fraud
✓ Manual underwriting leaves money on the table
✓ Rule-based trading cannot compete with ML algorithms
✓ Competition: Banks without ML are losing to those with ML
✓ Regulation: Regulators expect modern risk management

Bottom line: ML isn't optional anymore - it's survival.
